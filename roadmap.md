# Git Cheatsheets Roadmap

This roadmap outlines potential git cheatsheet files to create in this project, similar to `git-stash.md`. Each cheatsheet should follow a similar structure: lookup tables at the top, followed by examples, outliers, and how-tos.

## Core Git Commands
- `git-basics.md` - Essential commands: init, add, commit, status, log, diff
- `git-branching.md` - Branch management: branch, checkout, switch, merge
- `git-remotes.md` - Working with remotes: remote, push, pull, fetch, clone
- `git-history.md` - Exploring history: log, reflog, blame, bisect

## Advanced Operations
- `git-rebase.md` - Rebasing workflows and commands
- `git-merge.md` - Merging strategies and conflict resolution
- `git-reset-revert.md` - Undoing changes: reset, revert, checkout
- `git-tags.md` - Tagging releases and versions

## Collaboration & Workflow
- `git-collaboration.md` - Pull requests, forks, and team workflows
- `git-hooks.md` - Pre-commit, post-commit, and other hooks
- `git-submodules.md` - Managing submodules
- `git-worktrees.md` - Working with multiple worktrees

## Troubleshooting & Recovery
- `git-conflicts.md` - Resolving merge and rebase conflicts
- `git-recovery.md` - Recovering lost commits, stashes, or branches
- `git-cleanup.md` - Cleaning up: gc, prune, fsck

## Specialized Topics
- `git-aliases.md` - Creating and using git aliases
- `git-config.md` - Configuration settings and options
- `git-performance.md` - Optimizing git performance and large repos
- `git-security.md` - Best practices for secure git usage

## Priority Suggestions
1. `git-basics.md` - Foundation for all users
2. `git-branching.md` - Essential for any project
3. `git-remotes.md` - Crucial for collaboration
4. `git-merge.md` - Common workflow operations
5. `git-reset-revert.md` - Important for mistake recovery

Start with the priority list and expand as needed. Each cheatsheet should be concise yet comprehensive, focusing on practical usage.</content>
