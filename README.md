# Git Cheatsheets

A pocket-sized collection of practical Git cheatsheets — quick lookups, clear examples, and the occasional dad joke.

- Quick start: clone this repo and open `index-sama.md` for a guided table of contents.
- Browse folders like `core_git_commands/`, `advanced_operations/`, `collaboration_and_workflow/`, `troubleshooting_and_recovery/`, and `specialized_topics/` for focused cheatsheets.

Commands you might actually use:

```
git clone <repo-url>
code .                 # or open the files in your editor of choice
```

Contributing:

- Make a branch, add or edit a cheatsheet (one topic per `.md`), commit, push, and open a PR.
- Keep entries short, practical, and example-forward — less theory, more "how I actually fixed it".

Need to file an issue or suggest a cheat? Open an issue or send a PR — pull requests are welcome and encouraged.

Use responsibly: may reduce confusion, increase confidence, and occasionally cause fewer commit messages.

Enjoy!
