Be kind, be helpful, and assume positive intent. This is a small community resource — we welcome contributors of all backgrounds.

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, threats, hateful language, or sustained off-topic disruption. If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please open an issue or contact the repository owner.

To report: open a private issue titled `Code of Conduct report` and include relevant context and links. The maintainer (`RohitRavindra-dev`) will respond.

Thanks for keeping this space constructive and welcoming.
