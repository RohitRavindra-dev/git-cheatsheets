## Notes & Next Batches
- Use this file to track what's done and what's next. After each batch I will update these checkboxes.
- Next batch (planned): create `git-tags.md`, `git-submodules.md`, `git-worktrees.md` (I'll start these now).

Start with the priority list and expand as needed. Each cheatsheet uses a short lookup table at top, followed by examples, edge cases, and practical how-tos.

Start with the priority list and expand as needed. Each cheatsheet should be concise yet comprehensive, focusing on practical usage.</content>
