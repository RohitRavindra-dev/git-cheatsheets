# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to help! Keep it small, practical, and example-first.

- Branch from `main`: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`
- Make focused changes (one topic or fix per PR).
- Commit messages: short summary, optional longer body. Example:

```
Fix typo in git-stash.md

Explain why this change helps and any edge-cases it covers.
```

- Open a Pull Request against `main`. Include a short description and link to related cheatsheet(s).
- No formal tests required for docs, but please preview your markdown.
